  <h2>Libre Office Spellcheck</h2>

    Over the last several years daily driving Arch and Debian based Linux operating systems I've enountered many little quirks. One that's occured several times over the last few years is spell check not working. Most recently I encountered this with my Kubuntu 23.04 installation. Everything was working fine when suddenly the Libre Office spell checker ceased functioning.
    Let's go through 2 possible causes.

    <h3>Solution 1, Ensure Hunspell Is Installed</h3>
    <p>
    Let's start with a solution that fixed the problems I ran into while using Arch based distribution.
    <br>
    We'll do this by checking if Hunspell is installed. Hunspell is the spell checked used by many open source and proprietary programs.

    Here's how to check if Hunspell is installed with Arch based distos.
    pacman -Q hunspell
    pacman -Ss hunspell to list the packages.
    pacman -S hunspell.
    sudo pacman -S hunspell hunspell-en_us

    Here's how to check if Hunspell is installed with Debian based distros.
    dpkg-query --list
