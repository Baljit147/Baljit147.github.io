        <p>The Problem?</p>
        <p>
          Linux permissions are generally pretty straight forward, read, write, execute. 
          But what about if you want users to have write privileges but not delete? That’s what sticky bits are for.

        <p>The Problem?</p>
        <p>
          If you’ve used the terminal for any amount of time, you’ve probably run a command, only to realize you needed to include sudo. You could always hit the up arrowꜛ and type sudo at the beginning of the line,

        <p>Linux and Libre Office spell check issues are pretty common</p>
        <p>Over the last several years daily driving Arch and Debian based Linux operating systems I've enountered many little quirks. One that's occured several times over the last few years is spell check not working. Most recently I encountered this with my Kubuntu 23.04 installation. Everything was working fine when suddenly the Libre Office spell checker ceased functioning.
